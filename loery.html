            <h1>Web development</h1>
        <p id="cs" class="ms">orem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown 
            printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, 
            remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop 
            publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum</p>

                <li>option 2</li>
                <li>option 3</li>
            </ol>
        <h1>Why do we use it?</h1>
        </div>
        <p class="max max1">It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. 
            The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, 
            content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum 
            as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions 
            have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
        <h2>Where can I get some?</h2>
       <p id="in">There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected 
        humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to 
        be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat
         predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words,
          combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is
           therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc</p>

        <p>"Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium, totam rem aperiam, eaque ipsa
             quae ab illo inventore veritatis et quasi architecto beatae vitae dicta sunt explicabo. Nemo enim ipsam voluptatem quia voluptas 
             sit aspernatur aut odit aut fugit, sed quia consequuntur magni dolores eos qui ratione voluptatem sequi nesciunt. Neque porro

        <h2 class="font max">हम इसे क्यों प्रयोग करते हैं?</h2>
        <p>यह एक लंबा स्थापित तथ्य है कि जब एक पाठक एक पृष्ठ के खाखे को देखेगा तो पठनीय सामग्री से विचलित हो जाएगा. Lorem Ipsum का उपयोग करने का मुद्दा यह है 
            कि इसमें एक और अधिक या कम अक्षरों का सामान्य वितरण किया गया है, 'Content here, content here' प्रयोग करने की जगह इसे पठनीय English के रूप में 
            प्रयोग किया जाये. अब कई डेस्कटॉप प्रकाशन संकुल और वेब पेज संपादक उनके डिफ़ॉल्ट मॉडल पाठ के रूप में Lorem Ipsum उपयोग करते हैं, और अब "Lorem Ipsum" के लिए खोज अपने शैशव में कई वेब साइटों को उजागर करती है. इसके विभिन्न संस्करणों का वर्षों में विकास हुआ है, कभी दुर्घटना से, तो कभी प्रयोजन पर (हास्य और लगाव डालने के लिए).</p>
        <h4>de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum", का खंड 1.10.33, Cicero द्वारा 45 BC मे लिखा गया.</h3>
        <p>"On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of 
            pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal 
            blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil a
            nd pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and 
            <span>when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. </span> 
            in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have 
            to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he 
            rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."</h4>
