        <h2 style="color: rgb(241, 106, 9);">Front-End</h2>
        <p>While the term may sound a little technical, website front ends are really an everyday encounter for almost all of us. If you’ve opened an app to check the weather, or scrolled through today’s headlines on a website, you’ve interacted with a front end. </p>
        <h2>How is the front end developed?</h2>
        <p>creating a front end experience isn’t a one-person job. In fact, it takes a group of people to create a website that looks as good as it feels to use. 
            Most often, this group will be comprised of a front end developer — whose job it is to actually write the code for the functions of the website — and a UX or UI developer, who will work on the visuals of the website. 
            The front end experience usually goes through a few different stages of development, including the creation of wireframes (rough outlines of the user flow), prototypes (working examples of the site), and finally user testing.
        </p>
        <h2 class="heading" >
            What are Components in the front-end and why do we need them?
        </h2>
        <p class="information">
            Let's first address the following problem: It's not super clear what a Component is. Well, many experienced developers will think of the same thing, but that is not true for those who are new to the Front-End world or haven't really though much about architecture of their codebase.
            One of the reasons is that the front-end field as a whole is big, there are many developers and leaders that name things differently and might not always agree to what is what. Different things are refered with different names.
            For example, what is the difference between Component and Element? Or something else — when you hear Component, do you think about React? Or Vue? Or an HTML tag or tags?

        <h4>HTML:</h4>
        <p class="information">The <b>HyperText Markup Language</b> or  is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
            Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.
             HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <img> and <input> directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as..

        <h4>CSS:</h4>
        <p>
            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]
            CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.

        <h4>JavaScript</h4>
        <p class="information">
            JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2023, 98.7% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior,[10] often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
            JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[11] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).

        <h4>Bootstarp</h4>
        <p class="heading">
            Bootstrap is an HTML, CSS and JS library that focuses on simplifying the development of informative web pages (as opposed to web applications). The primary purpose of adding it to a web project is to apply Bootstrap's choices of color, size, font and layout to that project. As such, the primary factor is whether the developers in charge find those choices to their liking. Once added to a project, Bootstrap provides basic style definitions for all HTML elements. The result is a uniform appearance for prose, tables and form elements across web browsers. In addition, developers can take advantage of CSS classes defined in Bootstrap to further customize the appearance of their contents. For example, Bootstrap has provisioned for light- and dark-colored tables, page headings, more prominent pull quotes, and text with a highlight.

        <h4>React-js</h4>
        <p>
            React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library[3][4] for building user interfaces based on components. It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of individual developers and companies.[5][6][7]
            React can be used to develop single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like Next.js. Because React is only concerned with the user interface and rendering components to the DOM, React applications often rely on libraries for routing and other client-side functionality
